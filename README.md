Milestone 1:
    For bone picking, our code simply changes the bone color to white if it is highlighted.
    Our code matches the behavior shown in the reference version for bone rolling. For bone manipulation with the mouse,
    it isn't exactly like the reference, but you should be able to orient all bones in any position through a combination
    of camera movement/rotations and bone rotations.
    For skinning, our code appears to match the reference.

    Extra credit:
    - Find or create your own character model, rig, and skinning weights, and create some images showcasing different poses of the character.
    We made a folder named "extra_credit" in the src to hold the images of the model we found in different poses.
    The model itself can be viewed by pressing the Digit8 key.
