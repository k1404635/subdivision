Milestone 2: 
- Keyframe Animation
    - Implemented K, P, and R keys as specified by the specs. Our implementation matches
    the reference implementation. The animations will always take the shortest path between any two keyframes.
- Keyframe Preview
    - Rendered each keyframe to a texture and mapped those textures to the quads
    in the preview area. We did not implement optional scrolling so only the first 4 keyframes
    are visible in the preview section.
- Keyframe Management
    - Implemented U, Delete, and = keys to work as specified in the specs. 
    Selecting a keyframe will also highlight the keyframe with red. A red box will appear around the keyframe. 

Extra Credit: 
- Creative Scene
    - We created an elaborate animation of the Pokedance using the existing 
    human skeleton model and edited it into a video to go along with it.
